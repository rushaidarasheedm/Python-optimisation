# Optimizing Python Code for Performance

## Introduction
Python is widely used in data science, web development, and AI, but its performance can sometimes be a bottleneck. This guide explores **optimization techniques** to improve execution speed and efficiency in Python applications.

## Profiling: Identifying Performance Bottlenecks
Before optimizing, use **profiling tools** to find slow parts of the code.

### Using cProfile
```python
import cProfile

def compute():
    total = sum(range(10**6))
    return total

cProfile.run('compute()')
```
This outputs function execution times, helping focus on slow areas.

## Efficient Data Structures
### Use List Comprehensions Instead of Loops
Bad Practice:
```python
squares = []
for i in range(1000):
    squares.append(i**2)
```
Optimized:
```python
squares = [i**2 for i in range(1000)]
```
 **Why?** List comprehensions are **faster** because they use optimized internal C functions.

### Use Generators for Large Data Processing
```python
def large_numbers():
    for i in range(10**8):
        yield i  # Uses lazy evaluation

for num in large_numbers():
    print(num)
```
 **Why?** Avoids memory overload by **not storing** all numbers at once.

## Optimizing Loops & Functions
### Use Built-in Functions
Instead of:
```python
result = []
for num in numbers:
    result.append(abs(num))
```
Use:
```python
result = list(map(abs, numbers))  # Faster!
```
 **Why?** Built-in functions like `map()` and `sum()` are **optimized in C**.

### Use NumPy for Faster Computation
Instead of:
```python
numbers = [i**2 for i in range(10000)]
```
Use:
```python
import numpy as np
numbers = np.arange(10000)**2  # Much faster!
```
 **Why?** NumPy uses **vectorized operations** that outperform standard loops.

## Multi-threading & Parallel Processing
### Using Multiprocessing for CPU-bound Tasks
```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def square(n):
    return n**2

with Pool(4) as p:  # Utilize 4 CPU cores
    results = p.map(square, range(100000))
```
 **Why?** Multiprocessing uses multiple CPU cores, speeding up computation.

### Using Multithreading for I/O-bound Tasks
For tasks like **file I/O and API calls**, use threading:
```python
import threading

def fetch_data(url):
    print(f"Fetching from {url}")

urls = ["http://example.com"] * 10
threads = [threading.Thread(target=fetch_data, args=(url,)) for url in urls]

for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
```
 **Why?** Threads work best for **network requests & disk I/O**.

## Memory Optimization Techniques
### Use `__slots__` to Reduce Memory Usage in Classes
```python
class Optimized:
    __slots__ = ['name', 'age']
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```
 **Why?** Prevents Python from using extra memory for attribute storage.

### Delete Unused Variables to Free Memory
```python
data = [i for i in range(10**6)]
del data  # Free up memory!
```

## Leveraging Just-In-Time Compilation with PyPy
Instead of using **CPython**, switch to **PyPy**, a JIT-compiled Python interpreter:
```sh
pip install pypy
pypy my_script.py  # Runs much faster!
```
 **Why?** JIT compilation **speeds up Python execution** significantly.

## Conclusion
By applying **profiling, optimized data structures, parallel computing, and memory management**, you can **dramatically improve Python performance**. These techniques are especially valuable for roles in **AI, data science, and backend development at Google, Microsoft, and NVIDIA**.
